               <p>With a body based off of one of the most notable guitars in history and dressed in vintage white, the Squier Vintage Modified Ëœ70s Stratocaster electric guitar looks wonderfully familiar. Squier tweaks the classic to give it a custom look and feel. Modified means adding new twists to familiar designs. Squier's Vintage Modified series excels at just that, imparting hot-output chop-shop sound, feel and value to traditional instrument designs.</p>
